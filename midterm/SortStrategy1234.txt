Using Bubble Sort Algorithm:
Before sorting: [13, 0, 7, 1, 20, 19, 10, 2, 16, 10, 12]
After sorting: [0, 1, 2, 7, 10, 10, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20]
Number of swap: 23

Using Selection Sort Algorithm:
Before sorting: [13, 0, 7, 1, 20, 19, 10, 2, 16, 10, 12]
After sorting: [0, 1, 2, 7, 10, 10, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20]
Number of swap: 7

Using Insertion Sort Algorithm:
Before sorting: [13, 0, 7, 1, 20, 19, 10, 2, 16, 10, 12]
After sorting: [0, 1, 2, 7, 10, 10, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20]
Number of swap: 33
